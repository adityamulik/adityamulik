### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a **Software Engineer at Walmart Global Tech**, building **robust, scalable distributed systems** with a strong focus on backend architecture, cloud platforms, and production-grade reliability.

I actively work on **agentic AI workflows**, exploring how LLM-driven systems can be orchestrated safely and efficiently alongside traditional distributed architectures.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Spring Boot, FastAPI

**Frontend**
- React.js, JavaScript (HTML / CSS)

**Databases**
- MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j (Graph DB)

**Cloud & DevOps**
- GCP (Actively Working), past experience with AWS & Azure

**Agentic AI & Orchestration**
- LangChain (agent & workflow orchestration)
- Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)
- LLM workflow design, tool-calling, and multi-agent coordination

---

### ⚙️ Engineering Workflow (How I Build Systems)
When building **production-grade distributed applications**, my approach typically includes:
- Designing **clear service boundaries** and data ownership
- Building **fault-tolerant, observable services** (logging, metrics, tracing)
- Handling **concurrency, retries, idempotency, and failure modes**
- Leveraging **event-driven and async patterns** where applicable
- Integrating **agentic workflows** in a controlled manner with guardrails
- Ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability from day one
